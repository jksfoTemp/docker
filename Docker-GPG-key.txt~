We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

To initialize pass, run the following command using the public key generated from the previous command:

 pass init <your_generated_gpg-id_public_key>
 pass init 9EA6A9EF51AF318E33C896882B246446FDB0C677

The following is an example similar to what you see once you run the previous command:

mkdir: created directory '/home/molly/.password-store/'
Password store initialized for <generated_gpg-id_public_key>

Once you initialize pass, you can sign in and pull your private images. When Docker CLI or Docker Desktop use credentials, a user prompt may pop up for the password you set during the gpg key generation.

 docker pull molly/privateimage
